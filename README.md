# Neovim configuration

After using [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), I
have started my neovim journey to split the files up in order to learn Lua and
build my own personal development environment (PDE).

Additional plugins added are:

- [UndoTree](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree)
- [Render Markdown](https://github.com/MeanderingProgrammer/render-markdown.nvim)

Current theme in use:

- [Rose Pine](https://github.com/rose-pine/neovim)

EOF.
